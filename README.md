# The Road to Mastery

A simple calculator for achieving 10,000 hours of practice.


## About

This timeline chart is intended to give you a general sense of the time it takes to 
master a skill. There are assumptions built in:

* Mastery requires 10,000 hours of practice
* You practice all 52 weeks of the year
* Average lifespan is 80 years
* You choose a skill for which you have natural aptitude
* Your practice is voluntary and progressively more challenging

The 10,000 hours concept came from [a 1993 study](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1993-40718-001) 
and was later popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in [his book Outliers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)), 
but is just one part of the 
[ongoing dialogue](https://www.fastcompany.com/3027564/scientists-debunk-the-myth-that-10000-hours-of-practice-makes-you-an-expert) 
about expertise. A [recent study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289613000421) 
showed that some individuals can reach elite levels of performance with fewer hours of practice, 
while others require more hours or never attain mastery if they do not have the 
aptitude for that specific skill.
